## ShivNotes
### Or, at least, my version of it.

This is my version of the ShivNotes project we started during our time together at the Deloitte graduate training week. It is not complete.

There are so many places this code needs to be cleaned up, but, remember:

_Make it work, make it right, make it fast_

This code is:
- _Too big_ the single class needs to be broken into smaller, more focused classes.
- _Unsafe_ there needs to be more error handling, especially around the creation of notes.
